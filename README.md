# Bobey Dig

By [Allison Parrish](http://www.decontextualize.com/) for [NaNoGenMo
2019](https://github.com/NaNoGenMo/2019).

Another NaNoGenMo entry: *Moby Dick* rewritten with
[Pincelate](https://github.com/aparrish/pincelate/) so that it sounds like the
narrator has a headcold. For best results, enjoy with "a pitch-like potion of
gin and molasses."

An excerpt, alongside lines from the original:

    Towards thee I roll, thou all-destroying but unconquering whale;
    Toweded thee I roll, thou all-desdroidge bud aghogering whale;

    to the last I grapple with thee; from hell's heart I stab at thee;
    doed the lazd I grabel with thee; vrob helds heard I stabbe ed thee;

    for hate's sake I spit my last breath at thee.  Sink all coffins
    for haides chaig I spid bied lasd breathe ed thee.  Chig all coveds

    and all hearses to one common pool! and since neither can be mine,
    ad all herges doed whid kahbed boole! ad chied teither gad be byed,

    let me then tow to pieces, while still chasing thee, though tied
    led be thed doed doed pieges, while stilled chaige thee, though died

    to thee, thou damned whale!  Thus, I give up the spear!"
    doed thee, thou dabed whale!  Thus, I gived ub the sbeered!"

(You can use perform transformation on any text, of course. I used *Moby Dick*? because it seems to be [NaNoGenMo tradition](https://github.com/dariusk/NaNoGenMo-2014/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+moby)
to use it for experiments like these.)
